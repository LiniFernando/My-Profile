                <p>Unit 5: Gravitational Field
                    Competency 5.0: Uses laws and principles of gravitation to be productive in daily
                    pursuits and scientific work.
                    Competency level 5.1: Analyses the effect of gravitational force on objects using
                    Newton’s law of gravitation.
                    Number of periods: 08
                    Learning outcomes:
